## Description
HMTL Index-
    My HTML began with the body, header, nav, and main elements.

    Style CSS-
        My styling began with the body, header, nav, ul/li elements. The flex property was added to these elements and over time 

    Reset CSS-
        The Reset CSS document was made from a very bare version of my current CSS styling code, which will allow me in the future to modify any styling changes with ease (ex. if I change my mind with any colors or have any issues with media queary as styling changes arise).

*Disclaimer* Portfolio Links were added for:
 Work Two - Work Seven, but there are currently non-responsive as they are works in progress/ TBD through the course.

* Notes:
On various occasions, I joined our class' "Lounge" room on Discord. 
    In the Lounge, many students met and discussed bugs in our code. This helped me on various occasion with styling issues I had with Flexbox containers.
