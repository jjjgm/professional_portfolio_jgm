## Description
HMTL Index-
    My HTML began with the body, header, nav, and main elements.
    I remembered from previous lectures that the ID can only be used on a single element and I tried my best to remember that moving forward when adding divs.
    I did encounter a bug in which i ended up using the same name from an ID when working on adding images. (Shawn[TA] realized this when I had some styling issues). I did go back and rename each ID in each photo with a personalized name.
    I added comments to each section to help categorize where in the page the code would land.
    (It's possible that with time I will re-work this nomenclature to be more clever and intuitive.)

Style CSS-
    My styling began with the body, header, nav, ul/li elements. The flex property was added to these elements and over time.
    I did various trial-and-error saves while working alongside with the live browser. I had some initial complications with display flex on my work boxes. I changed the parent name and child name accordingly, and chose names that highlighted the area on the page that I was working on. 
    As images were added, I needed to consider spacing in the boxes and image spacing. I then played around with object fit, reszing, max width, heights, and margins in child div classes. 
    I spent a bit of time trying to get optimized styling across most screen sizes. Please see media queary(s) and comments for screen descriptions.
    I added comments to each section to help categorize where in the page the code would land.
    (It's possible that with time I will re-work this nomenclature to be more clever and intuitive.)

 Reset CSS-
    The Reset CSS document was made from a very bare version of my current CSS styling code, which will allow me in the future to modify any styling changes with ease (ex. if I change my mind with any colors or have any issues with media queary as styling changes arise).

*Disclaimer* NO currently working Portfolio Links were added for:
 Work Two - Work Seven, but there are currently non-responsive as they are works in progress/ TBD through the course.

## Usage
This project will function as a working portfolio throughout the length of the bootcamp program.

As projects are completed and/or worked on- I shall upload them in their corresponding workbox areas (flexbox containers). 

This page ultimately will be used as a professional portfolio to present to employers of our coding abilities (and more)!

## Instalation
1. Created a new repository in GitHub (making sure to create README file) named: professional_portfolio_jgm
2. Copied HTTPS link of new repo file from GitHub
3. Deployed terminal on my personal OS
4. Cloned repository into files: bootcamp/ homework folder (using git commands learned in week one)
5. Once succesful cloning of GitHub repo occured, from terminal, I opened VS Code application to begin coding process with command "code ."
6. Files were created for Index.html, Reset.css, Style.css
7. Folders were created for Assets, Images, and CSS.
9. I organized CSS files and index file into the asstes folder; both CSS files in the assets/css folder; and left Images folder alone with README file isolated.
8. I am ready to begin coding into the designated files.

## Contributions
On various occasions, I joined our class' "Lounge" room on Discord. 
    In the Lounge, many students met and discussed bugs in our code. This helped me on various occasion with styling issues I had with Flexbox containers. Here, I also re-learned about using # for ID in a div, instead of . for all which is class standard in a div in CSS styling.

    I recived a good amount of assistance from our TA, Shawn as well in the "Lounge".

    I had two tutoring sessions through our class bootcamp, in which I recived assitance with my code as well. I had help with the nav, padding, styling, and learning flex and headers and footers.
